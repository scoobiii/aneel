Key Insight:
Energy availability per capita is the primary structural determinant of long-term economic productivity.

Brazil’s structural gap:
• Energy consumption per capita remains below global averages.
• Regulatory uncertainty increases risk perception.
• Current constraints on energy expansion reduce competitiveness in cloud, AI, industrial and logistics sectors.

Economic impact:
Our analysis indicates that maintaining current restrictive energy frameworks could reduce potential GDP growth by 1.2–1.7 p.p. annually over the next decade due to lower capital inflows and lower industrial productivity.

Strategic conclusion:
A coordinated national effort to expand energy per capita — aligned across ministries, regulatory agencies and investment channels — is required to unlock the country’s full economic potential.
